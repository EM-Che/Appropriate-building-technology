Before starting, find a few tools that will help you out to make what else you'll need.

Saw of choice, you get a saw of choice.
Needle nose pliers - a one-tool revolution in itself.
Scissors, useful to have especially for the art.
Shovel, spadefork, wheelbarrow, and two tubs. For the gardening.

Laptop? Then wifi+ electricity is the mind-output formula.
