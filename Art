From opAlt_vocation:
Meet the linux art studio:
GIMP - I cannot say enough about GIMP. This program allows layers which go under or other your other ones, and with either a base
picture or clear canvas of different sizes, allows advanced editing and a pallette of many colors. Paintbrush, paint bucket, patterns,
select tools, transparencies, text, etc. You can probably do it with GIMP for whatever your need is.
On linux, simply use sudo apt-get install gimp.

Blender - Blender makes still frames into animations, and can model images in 3D as well. Follow the manual (online via program),
and Keyframes and 
Synfig - I took an animation tutorial on synfig and it felt more natural to me.
