Here's the open source deal:

My first thought is that this technology improvement increases the chance of dialog about a Resource-Based-Economy. Why is because while the plans are free, the materials still aren't.
I put large amount of faith in the home-garage lab. I think that many Americans can get the tools that they want, and design the materials.
Open source computer programming, is totally different. Open source coding is like this: http://www.halplotkin.com/SFGate002.htm
Everything on github is open source. It leads to it being much more collaborative. 
http://sourceforge.org/ is for computer programs.

So, this is open source design. Whereby perhaps utilizing a creative commons license, things can be developed and not sold but rather, made available for the next people, so long as they are not sold.

It gives you the recipe. The recipe is there <3

From this article about using open source software for Occupy Sandy: For the people in the open-source movement who realize where this is going, the next step is to replicate what the government does, but better. How do we out-compete the government using open-source tools? I can tell you that with Occupy Sandy we already did it. We had a better system up within a month — for managing work orders, inventory, requests, workflows. What if we had had that during the occupation? How much easier would life have been for managing the Zuccotti Park experience if there had been people trained in such a system? We’d have had vehicles, warehouses and kitchens all coordinated in a way that was sustainable and easy to plug into. If we can do that, it’ll become competition between us and other systems. Then we’re on the path to the type of changes that people in the open-source world realize is coming.
We’re using the term “open source” now, by the way, but usually I use the term “FLO,” which means “free/libre/open source.”
