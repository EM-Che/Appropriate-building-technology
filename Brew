then you would add the yeast in later with however much water etc you needed to add up to around 80 degrees.

Let sit for anywhere from one week to 2.5 weeks, to months and serve and enjoy.

Apples, 
potatoes, 
fruits,
rice, 
starches,

adding Barley = beer.
adding hops = flavorings, for beers.

These can be found and added into the distillery by second-harvests, pantries, food banks, or the tree/garden! <3 <3
