#Hacking Coffee

##Green coffee beans

There was this one time at Noisebridge in San Francisco, a group came in and showed how you could roast green coffee beans with an air popcorn popper. :)

Green coffee beans are not only super cheap compared to the roasted ones, they keep for a lot longer. So, while regular coffee goes bad in a few weeks, in their green form the coffee beans keep for up to a year.


#Coffee Substitutes

Green tea plant meets the opalternative gardening (see: gardening) requirements: they can be rapidly (as in, a matter of a year or few) propagated by cuttings of itself, which start more tea plants. Since the young leaves are used for tea, you could have tea any time you wanted. One plant will give about two cups a week, so, how much do you drink? Finally, they are tolerant of cold areas, a good 5+ zone, which is fast becoming the northern areas of the country.

Black tea is actually from the same plant as green tea is. Just fermented longer.


#Growing Coffee

The issues with growing coffee have been altitude and climate: it is generally a tropical plant which thrives at higher altitudes. So, someone should develop a low-altitude variety. One of these micro-ecofarms is going to.

Perhaps more than any other plant, it’s important to replicate the coffee plant’s natural environment: humidity, mist and filtered sunlight. Growing indoors is common in the United States, usually in a windowed room that lets in about 4-5 hours of sunlight a day (you can also use artificial lighting, which may be easier), and stays between 60 and 80 degrees during the day and doesn’t dip below 45 degrees at night. If you live in a warm climate, you can grow outdoors, but temperature regulation will be a challenge, because even one colder-than-usual night can destroy the plant.
