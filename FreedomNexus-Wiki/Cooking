Would you rather cook over something that's currently so simple, deceivingly so, such that you leave it and burn your food, or else can't get it up to a hot heat in order to do anything with cooking oil? 

#Wood

Cooking over wood- its actually very simple and rewarding and do-able if done right. A rocket stove is something that can be made for free, and makes free in that area. It also has the advantage of being very efficient on how it uses wood. So, it just burns the ends of the sticks. Any stove you set up, should shoot to just use the end of sticks as it's much more efficient that way than just everything. 

Trying to re-use heat with other things in your setup. For example, it cooks the meal and also heats hot water for a shower. Makes the [biochar]() and also heats the greenhouse. ETC! 

There's certain scope of wood in nature that is abundant; and certain scales which we should not go to. Small sticks like this, are so easy to find in any park, sidewalk, yard, trees drop them, forest, etc; and furthermore gathering for five minutes, to get a 45-minute burn? You could cook rice or beans over that, easy. This is the future.

#Biogas

Farmers who keep more than two heads of cattle or seven pigs generate enough fuel to meet their daily cooking needs. Larger livestock populations may produce excess.
