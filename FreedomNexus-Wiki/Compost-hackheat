Heating a house- 

4 alternative ways to heat your house

#compost

The basic idea behind a compost water heater is that tubing is coiled throughout the compost pile and then filled with water. The water within the tubing heats up substantially (and relatively quickly).

the pile will start with a compressed layer of compost followed by a layer of coiled tubing followed by a layer of compressed compost until you reach the desired height.
Since a compost water heater does not have a hot water tank, the tubing becomes the “tank” in this example. This means that the more tubing you use, the more hot water you will have available at a given time. Think long, relaxing shower versus being the last one in the house to get a shower.
One would just figure on cleaning stalls and garden residuals each September/October and spreading the piles the following May/June.
If you build one with wood chips, will heat for 18 months! In fact any plants at all, without exception, selection, preference or proportion.<br/>

and when you're done, you have a fantastic compost for your gardens.<br/>

- a compost furnace >97% efficient, perhaps optimistic!<br/>

- Many heating loops, aeration with a squirrelcage blower, water hose inside, 18-19 MJ/kg or 17,040-18,012 Btu/kg  on dry matter basis, 8~10,000 BTU/LB is frequently cited<br/>

- 120-160 degrees.

weekend project, lots of tubing (they say polyethylene)<br/>

technicals: anaerobic bacteria, compressed pile, water will get to 130 F or better no problem.

work: We don't plan on any kind of big house. The nice thing is, it's a day's work to set it up and a day's work to take it apart (am I right on that?) and then you have a huge amount of compost to add to the garden before, and the only byproduct of firewood is wood ash which is not nearly as valuable as compost imo.

Fuck yeah, fuck yeah: Berm a house on the northern exposure and compost pile heat the east and west.<br/>

Give the south full, greenhouse style sun and I say you've got it.

Hoping to get an email back from a permaculture expert in Wisconsin, which will describe more of the means on how to keep a house warm in the winter -- where it gets to be -20 degrees!

#wood <br/>

I would not want to eliminate wood heat, I love the ambiance and also having one really warm place, but it would be nice to not have to burn tons of wood like I have to do sometimes.

Folks East have said wood is priced there, wood stoves hard to come by.... if you haven got dead trees around then a wood cookstove isn't necessarily right for you. Chainsaw, axe, bar oil, gasoline, etc and: when it's not February.

I read somewhere there is no task as fun or satisfying as chopping wood. Wear heavy boots :) Everyone has their own technique. Once youŕe sure you can put the blade onto the wood, give it all the power you've got!
