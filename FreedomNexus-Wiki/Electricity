Most things you know use an outlet to plug into. An inverter, turns into 110/120V for that [cell phone]() charger, even fridge, washer/dryer etc. 
Here's a great inverter that gives you a good amount of Wattage (flow pull). http://www.ebay.com/itm/OSP-3000W-POWER-INVERTER-DC-AC-3000-6000-WATT-/111172958310

Compare that with the wind turbine Wattage output, or what your solar panel,  below.
