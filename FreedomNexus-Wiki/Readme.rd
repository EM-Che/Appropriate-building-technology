How we are going to make everything free? <br/>

You are welcome to prepare for yourself the freedom build by June 4th. Many of these designs are made using free materials. Otherwise, even things like home electricity can be managed on a very low budget. We hope you will consider the alternative lifestyle presented herein, and on June 4th, we opt out. Please, if you know other folks who are in the movement and have been since the camps went down, let's get this going.
[http://occupy-anonymous.org/](http://occupy-anonymous.org), a hub of art, ability, creativity, and new culture. Be free, join us.

In other words as the live, fresh spirulina lab technician said on eBay - "... as long as this is not sold." Do it right, please :)
