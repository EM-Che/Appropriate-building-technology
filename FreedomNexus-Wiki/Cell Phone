#Hate phones

Hate, what it does to people expecting you to be available in contact all the time. ANYWAYS, that's how anons are also. Who uses cell phones? The 99%. Good news is, we get cell phones :) In the future, this is really only one of the few things that it would be nice to have a government provide for us.

#Free Cell Phones

If you're in real life and want a cell phone that works, like a phone then there's a few different sites you can go to for a free phone and minutes.<br/>

I appreciate that a freedom-tolerating government offers these phones to those who need, in the future I think a freedom loving government could provide phones that are free of surveillance as a nice service. 

Many choices available, all under the LifeLink program.

One of these comes in a few weeks after you send them some kind of income proof, and you get over two hundred minutes a month for over two years and unlimited text. <3, there's some good love there.



#Alternative Phone?

What other kinds of free phone hacks are there so far or could be out there? Landline phone?
