Let's find out:
If rice, did you know that one hundred square feet yields 10 pounds? That's near enough for the full year!

#Fences <br/>
Most fences don't grow anything. Try -

. perennial climbing beans- they'll come up every year and give you thick wide beans you can eat young and tender or keep till they are old for 'dried' beans. They'll also cover your fence with greenery and bright red flowers

. chokos- eat the shoots as well as the fruit

. hops- hops die down in winter and ramble all over the place in summer. Eat the young shoots in early spring; make beer from the flowers or use them to stuff hop pillows.

. passionfruit in frost free places; banana passionfruit in cold areas

. loganberries, marionberries, boysenberries and other climbing berries, trained up wire stapled to the fence

. grapes - there are hundreds of grape varieties in Australia - suitable for any area, from snowy winters to tropical summers

. edible Chinese convulvulus

. sweet potatoes (temperate areas only)

. or use your fence to stake up tomatoes, peas, broad beans.

#Fruit Trees <br/>
The area next to the fence is the best for large fruit trees. Hedge your garden boundaries with tall fruit trees. Plant them 2 metres apart. They'll grow tall and the branches will tangle - but this means birds won't find most of the fruit (though you will) and tall trees bear as much fruit as wide ones - you just have to climb the tree or use a fruit picker on a tall stick to get the crop. You can also coppace, which leaves them at a bush-height. In these ways you'll be able to have a far greater variety of fruit than you would with a normally planted orchard.

The selection is up to you- what grows best in your area and what you like to eat. [Fruit trees]()

Plant dwarf fruit trees along paths as a hedge - dwarf apples, dawf peaches, pomegranates or nectarines - or trees like hazelnuts that can be trimmed to a neat hedge.

#Small fruit <br/>
Next to the trees plant 'small fruit' - raspberries, blueberries tamarilloes, pepinoes, pineapples, tamarilloes, elder trees for flowers and berries, kumquats, guavas strawberry guavas, chilean hazelnuts.

Most 'small fruit' is naturally an understory crop anyway- they accept shade for at least part of the day. They will also cast much less shade over the next part of your garden. You can also plant 'small fruit' among the 'permanent' beds.

#A Greenhouse:
Yes, this should go in here. Meets all the good opalternative criteria. Just- where does PVC come from? hmm.. [http://www.pvcplans.com/ArchGrnHouse.pdf](http://www.pvcplans.com/ArchGrnHouse.pdf)

Just, spend your money on freedom and don't pay back the banks. (This is, really, the Delete.)
