Volunteers are the heart of the city.
Outreach - Chicago

We are assisted by full time volunteers who live in community at the Marquard Center. These volunteers spend an entire year working directly with the men and women we serve, including performing various shelter jobs at Franciscan House.

Franciscan House needs community volunteers each night to greet and serve supper to guests, as well as help with daily shelter logistics. If you are interested in volunteering some of your time at Franciscan House, check the Shelter Volunteer page to learn more.

Supporting the Shelter Facilities

We are always in need of soap, deodorant, toothpaste, feminine hygiene products and other personal items. Whether  you save them from a hotel stay or you buy them at the local store, these items are always appreciated. Our case managers provide our guests with vouchers to clothing distributors, so we do not usually accept clothing, except on rare occasions (such as winter coats, gloves, scarves, etc.) You can always check our Wish List to see what items are most needed.

Monetary donations are always appreciated. You may donate online or through phone or email.
